# AppPin

The Fortune 500 is an annual list compiled and published by Fortune magazine that ranks 500 of the largest United States corporations by total revenue for their respective fiscal years.

AppPin is inspired by Fortune500 but concentrated on mobile applications. Unlike corporate statistics, apps are unstable data due to a large user base and timely modifications in ratings and reviews. The current version of AppPin utilizes the data of top apps on the google play store as of January 2022.

AppPin dashboards allow the users to pick the right choice of apps and allow the app developers to compare their production with other existing apps.

The data was collected with the help of Appium an open-source framework for mobile app automation testing, and python. The dataset contains the top 500 android apps available on the google play store for various categories

The dataset contains the **top 500 android apps** available on the google play store for the following categories:
All Categories, Art & Design, Auto & Vehicles, Beauty, Books & Reference, Business, Comics, Communication, Education, Entertainment, Events, Finance, Food & Drink, Health & Fitness, House & Home, Libraries & Demo, Lifestyle, Maps & Navigation, Medical, Music & Audio, News & Magazines, Parenting, Personalization, Photography, Productivity, Shopping, Social, Sports, Tools, Travel & Local, and Video Players & Editors.

The app rankings are based on google play store app rankings for **January 2022**.


We have extracted the data of various apps from the google play store based on their rankings. Google doesn't provide any public data sets of the apps and hence we needed to extract the data. We used an automation tool called **Appium** along with python to interface with the mobile google play store app and extract the data.
